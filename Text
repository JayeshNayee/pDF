CHAPTER NO –1 Introduction to communication systems Marks
TOPIC:1 Communication System 
SHORT QUESTIONS
1. Define Communication. [LJIET]
Ans: Communication is a data transmitting technique in a format that utilizes 
continuous signals to transmit data including voice, image, video, electrons etc.
01
2. What is meant by analog communication syste[LJIET]
Ans: A communication format in which information is transmitted by modulating a 
continuous signal, such as a sound wave. Current TV and radio signals are analog, as 
are many telephone lines.
01
3. What is meant by digital communication system?[LJIET]
Ans: Digital communication is a mode of communication where the information or the 
thought is encoded digitally as discreet signals and electronically transferred to the 
recipients.
01
4. Define modulation (May’2017)[LJIET]
Ans: In electronics and telecommunications, modulation is the process of varying one 
or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating 
signal that typically contains information to be transmitted.
01
5. What is the need of modulation?(May’2017)[LJIET]
Ans: Modulation allows us to send a signal over a bandpass frequency range. If every 
signal gets its own frequency range, then we can transmit multiple signals 
simultaneously over a single channel, all using different frequency ranges. Another 
reason to modulate a signal is to allow the use of a smaller antenna.
